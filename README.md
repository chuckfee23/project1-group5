## Description and Requirements 

Our group will use everything we’ve learned over the past six modules to create a real-world front-end application that we’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. 

A user wants more nutritional information regarding the food they are eating on a daily basis. Our application allows you to search for ingredients, the search will provide a photo and nutritional facts.
